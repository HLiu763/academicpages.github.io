Hi! I am a first-year Phd student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I obtained a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Shadong University and a master’s degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University.

I am honored to conduct research advised by Professor Aditya Prakash. 

My recent research interest is time series analysis and LLM. My past research interests have been graph neural networks and recommender systems.

My working location is CODA S1349. I am open to cooperation!

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, movies and basketball.
