Hi! I am a first year graduate student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Shadong University.

I conduct research under the supervision of Professor Aditya Prakash. 

My recent research interest is time series analysis. My past research interests have been graph neural networks and recommender systems.

I am open to cooperation!
